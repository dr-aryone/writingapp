Novel writing app

I am building a basic CRUD app here, it's nothing exciting yet, but I'm enjoying it immensely. 

Jan 20 update, the app is now "complete" but still far from finished. It needs its routes secured, design and interface tweaks and better navigation. Angular tests are failing due to Node backend changes, too. Next up, bug fixes, better navigation and route security.

As of Jan 19, I have a good start on the authentication and am bringing some of the API endpoints live. This app is by no means ready for production and is not fully secured yet. Work on fully developing the endpoints, securing the app and completing the design is coming in the following weeks.
